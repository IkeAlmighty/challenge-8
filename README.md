# Vehicle Builder - Challenge 8

Follow [this link]() to the video walkthrough.

Challenge 8 is to complete the implementation of a CLI based vehicle builder/simulator. 

Implementation included completing a Truck class, Motorbike class, and implementing Truck.tow method as well as a Motorbike.wheelie method.

## Modules Used

 - Inquirer - This is a handy module for accepting user input from the command line. The app utilizes this module to let the user create vehicles and operate them.
 - Typescript - The app is written in typescript and compiled into javascript to run in a nodejs command line environment.

## Challenges

I struggled with implementing some of the methods required in this challenge namely because I'm not used to completing an existing codebase. While implemeting the classes themselves was not too hard, implementing the controller logic became challenging because the starter code was not well organized and was dropped into a single file. If I had more time, I would try to seperate the controller logic across multiple files to create more clarity in the code.
